# BlazorSimpleAppExample
A very simplified example of how to get a project up and running with Blazor. Includes SignalR, Databinding to forms, Error Handling, JSON serialization/deserialization, and a quick example of using a controller for Http requests.

Please note this is meant to be an ultra simplified example. One of the things that truly annoys me about picking up new tech is white papers and example applications that overcomplicate the architecture to the point that it becomes a second job to understand what's going on.

This example app will boil down to the very basics. An experienced engineer can pretty much take this and run with it.
